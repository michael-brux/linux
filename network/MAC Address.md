# MAC Address

A **MAC (Media Access Control) address** is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for use as a network address in communications within a network segment. Think of it as a physical or hardware address for your network card (like the Ethernet port or Wi-Fi adapter) on your computer, phone, or other network-connected device.

**Key Points:**

1.  **Uniqueness:** Each MAC address is intended to be globally unique and is typically assigned by the manufacturer of the network hardware.
2. **Format:** It's usually represented as a sequence of 12 hexadecimal digits (0-9 and A-F), often grouped in pairs separated by colons or hyphens (e.g., `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E` or `00-1A-2B-3C-4D-5E`).
3. **Purpose:** MAC addresses are used for communication between devices on the **same local network** (like your home Wi-Fi). They operate at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) of the network model.
4. **Hardware-Based:** Unlike an IP address (which is logical and can change), a MAC address is typically burned into the hardware, though it can sometimes be changed in software ("MAC spoofing").
5. **Local vs. Global:** MAC addresses identify devices locally, while IP addresses are used to route traffic across different networks (like the internet).

In short, a MAC address is the **permanent, unique hardware identifier for a device's network adapter**, crucial for direct communication on a local network.
